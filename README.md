# GrowRig Platform

Grow Core and the Grow App Web — the software half of [GrowRig](../growrig),
an open-source, local-first ecosystem for controlled indoor growing.

This repository currently implements the **Phase 2 vertical slice** from the
[roadmap](../growrig/ROADMAP.md): a Go control engine with persistent storage, a
built-in simulator, a live API, and a SvelteKit dashboard. It runs end-to-end
**without any hardware** — the simulator stands in for a Grow Controller so you
can see the whole system working before flashing a single ESP32.

## What works today

- **Domain model** — environments with climate targets; devices with fan
  channels mapped to semantic roles (exhaust / intake / circulation).
- **Reconciliation engine** — a proportional control law turns *current vs.
  target temperature* into desired fan speeds, with an emergency-temperature
  override that forces every fan to 100%.
- **Adapters** — a **Home Assistant** adapter (reads climate sensors over the
  HA WebSocket API, commands fans via `fan.set_percentage`) and a built-in
  **simulator** (a small physical model where temperature responds to fan
  speed) — selected purely by config.
- **YAML configuration** — one binary, two deployments: HAOS add-on (via the
  Supervisor proxy) or remote HA for local dev, differing only by config.
- **Persistence** — SQLite (pure-Go driver, no CGO) stores configuration and
  climate history.
- **Live API** — REST for configuration + a WebSocket that streams the full
  system snapshot every control tick.
- **Web dashboard** — live temperature/humidity sparklines with target lines,
  controller health, per-fan speed/RPM, and a Setup page for targets and role
  mapping.

## Quick start (offline simulator)

No Home Assistant or hardware required — two processes:

**1. Grow Core** (Go 1.24+):

```bash
cd growcore
go run ./cmd/growcore -config growcore.sim.yaml   # listens on :8080
```

**2. Grow App Web** (Node 20+):

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev                      # http://localhost:5173
```

The web app talks to Grow Core at `http://localhost:8080` by default. To point
it elsewhere, set `VITE_GROWCORE_URL` (see [`web/.env.example`](web/.env.example)).

Open the dashboard, go to **Setup**, and lower the temperature target below the
current reading — the exhaust fan will ramp up on the dashboard within a second.

## Install on Home Assistant

Grow Core ships as a **local Home Assistant OS add-on** in
[`addon/growrig/`](addon/growrig/). Build the arch-matched binaries and copy the
folder onto your HAOS host:

```bash
make addon        # cross-compiles addon/growrig/bin/growcore.{aarch64,amd64,armv7}
```

Copy `addon/growrig/` to the `addons` share (`/addons/growrig/`), then in Home
Assistant open **Settings → Add-ons → Add-on Store → ⋮ → Check for updates** and
install **GrowRig — Grow Core** from *Local add-ons*. The add-on reaches Home
Assistant through the Supervisor proxy (no token needed) and serves the
dashboard on host port `8099` by default. See
[`addon/growrig/README.md`](addon/growrig/README.md) for details.

## Configuration

Grow Core is configured with YAML. The same binary runs in three modes,
selected by `adapter.type` and the config file you pass with `-config`:

| File | Mode | Home Assistant |
|---|---|---|
| [`growcore.yaml`](growcore/growcore.yaml) | **Default — HAOS add-on** | Supervisor proxy (`http://supervisor/core`, `$SUPERVISOR_TOKEN`) |
| [`growcore.dev.yaml`](growcore/growcore.dev.yaml) | Local dev vs. remote HA | `http://homeassistant.local:8123` + long-lived token |
| [`growcore.sim.yaml`](growcore/growcore.sim.yaml) | Offline simulator | none |

`${ENV_VAR}` references in the file are expanded at load, so tokens stay out of
version control. For local development against your own Home Assistant:

```bash
export GROWCORE_HA_TOKEN=eyJ...          # HA → Profile → Long-lived access tokens
go run ./cmd/growcore -config growcore.dev.yaml
```

The config declares environments, devices, and how each device's sensors and
fan channels bind to Home Assistant entities. Edit the `sensor.*` / `fan.*`
entity ids to match your ESPHome controller. Running with no config file at all
uses the built-in simulator defaults.

## Grow Core API

Base URL `http://localhost:8080`.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/health` | Liveness probe |
| `GET` | `/api/state` | Latest full snapshot |
| `GET` | `/api/roles` | Assignable channel roles |
| `GET` | `/api/environments` | List environments |
| `PUT` | `/api/environments/{id}/targets` | Set `{targetTempC, targetHumidity}` |
| `GET` | `/api/environments/{id}/history?limit=120` | Climate history (oldest first) |
| `GET` | `/api/devices` | Devices with live values + roles |
| `PUT` | `/api/devices/{id}/channels/{ch}/role` | Assign `{role}` to a channel |
| `GET` | `/api/ws` | WebSocket: streams a snapshot each control tick |

Flags: `-config growcore.yaml` (config path), `-addr :8080` (overrides
`server.addr`). All other settings — storage path, control interval, adapter —
come from the config file.

## Architecture notes

Grow Core is structured as the docs describe — a reconciliation engine that is
independent of any single adapter:

```
growcore/internal/
├── config/     # YAML config: modes, adapters, device topology & entity bindings
├── domain/     # semantic model: environment, device, channel, role
├── control/    # pure control law + reconciliation loop + Adapter interface
├── sim/        # simulator adapter
├── ha/         # Home Assistant adapter (WebSocket state + REST commands)
├── store/      # SQLite persistence
└── api/        # HTTP + WebSocket
```

Adapters implement `control.Adapter`, so the engine and the pure control law
(`control.ChannelSpeed`, unit tested via `go test ./...`) are identical whether
devices are simulated or reached through Home Assistant. New adapters (e.g.
direct MQTT) slot in behind the same interface without touching domain logic.

### Deviations from the target design

- **Storage** uses the pure-Go `modernc.org/sqlite` driver (no CGO) rather than
  a CGO build, to keep cross-compilation for the Grow Hub trivial. Schema and
  API are unchanged.
- The Home Assistant adapter uses **`fan.set_percentage`** for commands. If your
  ESPHome PWM outputs are exposed as `number`/`light` entities instead of `fan`
  entities, that service call needs adjusting.

## Next steps (per roadmap)

- Direct MQTT adapter with one authoritative adapter per controller (Phase 3).
- Controller health/presence and command timeout surfaced in the UI.
- Recipes and cycles (phase-based targets over time).
- Manual overrides and alerts.
